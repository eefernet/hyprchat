## Alpha v16.2 — April 22, 2026

### Rich Rendering Polish
- **GitHub-style callouts** — `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]` render as coloured admonition boxes (blue / green / warm / orange / red) with icon and label header. Subsequent `> ` lines are collected as body. Models pick these up from the updated backend RENDERING system message and use them for caveats, tips, and warnings without prompting.
- **Keyboard key caps** — `<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>` renders as raised key caps with gradient bg, thick bottom border, and monospace face. Makes shortcut-heavy how-to answers legible at a glance.
- **Inline color swatches** — Hex codes (`#rrggbb`, `#rrggbbaa`), `rgb(…)`, `rgba(…)`, `hsl(…)`, `hsla(…)` in chat text auto-render with a small clickable colour chip next to the code. No special syntax — plain mentions get upgraded. Great for design/CSS chats.
- **Inline charts** — New ` ```chart ` code fence parses JSON via Chart.js. Supported types: `bar`, `line`, `pie`, `doughnut`, `scatter`, `radar`, `polarArea`. Simple form: `{"type":"bar","labels":[...],"data":[...]}`; multi-series via `"datasets":[...]`. Dataset colors auto-pick from the active theme palette (`acc`/`ok`/`warm`/`err`/derived tints). Grid, ticks, title, and tooltip all theme-synced. Source toggle + copy button matching `MermaidBlock`. Pairs Chart.js 4.4.4 UMD (~80 KB) loaded from jsDelivr.
- **Table renderer rewrite** — Pipe tables now group contiguous rows into one real `<table>` with proper `<thead>` styling (uppercase, accent-colored, surface background) and `<tbody>` row separators. The divider row (`|:---:|---:|---|`) is parsed for `left` / `center` / `right` alignment per column and applied to both header and body cells. Cells now wrap (`wordBreak: break-word`) instead of the previous `whiteSpace: nowrap` + ellipsis that silently truncated real model output. Horizontal scroll container for tables wider than the bubble.
- **Shared `_consumed` set across line rendering** — Refactored the inner `seg.split("\n").map(...)` in `md()` to pull `_lines` and a `_consumed` Set out into segment scope. Callout and table handlers use this to mark multi-line blocks so subsequent lines skip rendering, cleanly replacing the old per-line attribution lookahead pattern.
- **`ChartBlock` component** — Mirrors `MermaidBlock`: canvas element inside a bordered container with header pill (`◈ chart`), source toggle, copy button, and red error banner plus raw JSON on parse/render failure. Chart instance destroyed + rebuilt on code or theme change (reuses `mermaidEpoch` as the theme-change signal). Circular chart types get per-slice palette colors; axis charts get translucent fills.
- **Backend RENDERING hint extended** — `chat.py` system message now documents callouts, `<kbd>`, colors, and chart fences alongside the existing mermaid/math guidance so models reach for them unprompted.
- **No-more-matplotlib steer** — RENDERING hint's "do not generate with tools" rule now explicitly forbids using `execute_code` / `generate_code` / `write_file` + matplotlib / seaborn / plotly / `pandas.plot` to save a chart image when a ```chart fence would render the same data. Code tools are reserved for *computing* values; visualisation of values already in hand goes through the fence.
- **Deep Researcher persona — Presenting Findings section** — The seed preset (`mc-preset-deepresearch`) gained a dedicated "Presenting Findings — Use Rich Rendering" section that routes quantitative data to ```chart fences, source-conflict caveats to `[!NOTE]`, material-conclusion changes to `[!IMPORTANT]`, deprecations / security issues to `[!WARNING]` / `[!CAUTION]`, actionable advice to `[!TIP]`, multi-attribute comparisons to aligned tables, and keys/commands to `<kbd>`/inline code. Explicit "chart fence > Python matplotlib" rule for research data.
- **Preset seeder now upserts** — `seed_deep_researcher` previously only inserted on first boot, so existing installs never saw prompt updates. It now UPDATEs the `system_prompt` + `tool_ids` + `updated_at` columns when the preset row already exists, preserving the user's model choice / KB assignments / parameters. Version-bump prompt and tool-list updates land automatically on next server start.
- **RENDERING hint restructured — compute-then-chart pattern** — The earlier "do NOT call execute_code to produce a chart" clause was over-broad and risked suppressing `execute_code` for legitimate math. The hint is now split into three explicit sub-sections: **Visualisation** (fence-only, prohibits `write_file`/matplotlib `savefig` but never names `execute_code` in a prohibition), **Computation** (explicitly endorses `execute_code` for arithmetic / aggregation / CAGR / variance / weighted-average work — "the prohibition above is purely about saving image files, not about running code"), and a dedicated **compute-then-chart pattern** section showing the two-step flow: run `execute_code` to compute, print JSON to stdout, then emit a ```chart fence with the computed values. LLM mental math is unreliable past trivial cases; the sandbox is trusted.
- **Deep Researcher gains `execute_code`** — `tool_ids` updated from `["deep_research"]` to `["deep_research", "execute_code"]` on both fresh seeds and existing-install upserts. The persona's prompt added a new `## Computation` section mandating `execute_code` for CAGR/CMGR, weighted averages, variance, percentage shares, date/unit conversion, and any aggregation on research results — with an explicit "a chart with wrong numbers is worse than no chart" rule. Existing `## Skip the Tool When` section replaced with a clearer `## Tool Selection — Which One, When` table routing pure math to `execute_code`, substantive questions to `deep_research`, and trivial lookups to neither.
- **Research-loop guardrails** — Observed in practice: on a test prompt about 2025 EV sales, the model chained 6 `deep_research` calls across 20+ minutes looking for "exact full-year numbers" that weren't yet audited/published, never reaching the `execute_code` + chart step. `DEEP_RESEARCHER_PROMPT` gained an `## Avoiding Research Loops — CRITICAL` section enforcing (1) a hard **2-call same-topic cap** — once two calls on the same underlying topic both return approximate/similar data, synthesis happens, no third call — and (2) a **recency realism** rule treating "projected" / "estimated" / "preliminary" / "YTD" figures as the answer rather than an invitation to re-search. Uncertainty flows into `> [!NOTE]` / `> [!CAUTION]` callouts rather than another tool round. Prevents runaway context growth and minute-per-round wall-clock costs on questions whose "exact" answer doesn't publicly exist yet.

### Effort Level — Iterative Self-Review
- **Scalable response quality** — After the initial answer is finished, the model re-examines its own response and produces a refined version. Runs 0–3 additional review passes. Each pass can call tools (`research`, `fetch_url`, etc.) to verify claims before refining.
- **4 creative levels** — 💭 **Blurt** (raw, no review) / 🧠 **Ponder** (1 pass) / 🔥 **Forge** (2 passes) / 🌌 **Galaxy Brain** (3 passes).
- **Global default + per-chat override** — Settings has a "Default Effort Level" chip row. Each chat gets a compact emoji chip next to the input that lets the user override for just that conversation (new chats inherit the global default).
- **Replace-with-final UX** — During refinement, the streamed answer is wiped and re-streamed each round; only the polished final version stays in the bubble. Live pill shows "✨ Refining answer (1/3)..." during each pass. Finished messages carry an `✨ Refined N×` badge next to the timestamp.
- **Mechanism** — New `effort_rounds` field on `ChatRequest`. `chat_stream_generate` re-enters the main agent loop after the "no more tool calls" exit, appending a critique prompt that asks the model to check for factual errors, logical gaps, missing context, or unclear phrasing. The existing `MAX_AGENT_ROUNDS` cap still governs total rounds so review can't runaway.
- **New SSE event** — `refinement_start` `{round, total}` signals each review pass to the frontend. The `done` payload now carries `refinements: N` which is persisted to the message metadata so the badge survives reload.
- **Storage** — `localStorage["hc-effort-level"]` for the global default; `localStorage["hc-effort-per-chat"] = {convId: level}` for per-chat overrides. No DB migration needed.


## Alpha v16.1.1 — April 22, 2026

### Rich Rendering
- **Mermaid.js diagrams** — ` ```mermaid ` code fences render inline as live SVG: flowcharts, sequence, class, state, ER, gantt, mindmap, pie. Theme-synced (34 mapped variables) and re-render when the user switches themes mid-conversation.
- **KaTeX math** — Inline `$...$`, display `$$...$$`, and LaTeX `\(...\)` / `\[...\]` delimiters all render as typeset math. Code blocks are ignored so `$` in source stays literal.
- **`<MermaidBlock>` component** — Header with `◈ mermaid` label, source toggle, and copy button matching existing code-block styling. Broken diagrams show a red error banner plus the raw source instead of breaking the message.
- **`<MDWrap>` wrapper** — Wraps 8 render surfaces (chat, council cards, HF README, changelog modal) and invokes KaTeX auto-render after mount. Streaming messages skip wrapping so partial tokens don't flicker.
- **Multi-line display math** — `md()` pre-splits non-code segments by `$$...$$` before line-splitting so equations spanning multiple lines render as one KaTeX node instead of fragmenting across `<div>`s.
- **Backend rendering hint** — `chat.py` injects a system message telling the model diagrams/math render inline (not via `write_file` or `generate_code`) and explicitly warns against embedding `$...$` LaTeX inside Mermaid node labels.
- **Display-math escape inside inline code** — `md()` now masks `$$` and `$` inside single-line backtick inline code before the display-math split, so documentation examples that quote a math delimiter render as inline code instead of being yanked out as a math block.
- **GFM task lists** — `- [ ]` / `- [x]` render as real checkboxes with strikethrough on completed items (read-only; reflects the markdown state).
- **Collapsible `<details>`/`<summary>`** — Raw HTML `<details>` blocks render as interactive collapsibles with a chevron. New top-level `Collapsible` component.
- **Diff code blocks** — fences tagged `diff` color `+` / `-` / hunk / metadata lines using the active theme's `ok`/`err`/`acc`/`mut` channels.
- **Syntax highlighting** — Prism.js autoloader loaded via CDN; every code fence gets `language-X` highlighting via a new `CodeBlock` component that runs `Prism.highlightElement` after mount. Copy button and language chip preserved.
- **Footnotes** — `[^label]` / `[^label]: …` pairs render as superscript numeric links with smooth-scroll to an auto-appended footnote block. Unique per-render IDs prevent collisions across messages.

### Message Actions
- **Timestamps fixed** — `created_at` now set at every in-session construction site (send, regenerate, edit, council) and preserved across streaming updates by spreading the prior message object. Fixes HH:MM labels that never appeared until a page reload. Reload path also preserves `id` + `created_at` from the backend.
- **Regenerate with…** — The plain regenerate button is now a split button; the ▾ chevron opens a popover to pick a one-shot model / temperature / persona override for this single retry. `sendMessages` and `regenerate` accept an `overrides` parameter.
- **Delete message with undo** — New trash button per message; removes immediately, shows a 5-second undo snackbar via a new fixed-position `ToastHost`. Backend: `DELETE /api/conversations/{conv_id}/messages/{msg_id}` + `db.delete_message()`. FTS trigger auto-syncs the search index.
- **Collapsible python output** — Each code-output block header is click-to-toggle; ▾ rotates to show collapsed state. In-memory per `{msgIndex, outputIndex}`; default expanded.

### Themes
- **Contrast rebalance** — Seven harshest themes rebalanced to meet readable minimums (text ≥7:1, dim ≥4.5:1, mut ≥3:1) without losing identity: Terminal (tamed neon body text, kept Matrix green accent), Cyberpunk (softened pure-magenta), Solarized Dark (lifted the famously-dim gray body text), Gruvbox (raised the dark-teal `f4`), Dracula (`mut` readable), Rosé Pine (fixed inverted dim/text hierarchy), Midnight (`mut` lifted). Nord, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, One Light, Ayu Dark, Material Ocean, Solarized Light untouched.

### Persistence & Streaming Robustness
- **User message save moved server-side** — Frontend no longer POSTs the user message separately. `chat_stream_generate` defensively persists the latest user message at stream start if the DB's most-recent user row doesn't match. Eliminates the fire-and-forget race that silently dropped user messages on flaky networks (and the duplicate it caused when both paths fired).
- **Stable message order** — `get_conversation` now orders by `created_at ASC, id ASC`, so same-second user/assistant pairs (typical on fast greetings) can't flip on reload.
- **Stream-clobber fix** — New `streamingCidRef` tracks the conversation being streamed; `loadConversation` skips the messages-array overwrite when loading the streaming conv. Previously, switching away mid-stream and back could fetch a backend snapshot with only the user message; the in-progress `m[m.length-1]` stream update then overwrote the user message with assistant content, making it disappear.
- **Pills race fix** — New `streamSaveEvtsRef` accumulates events independently of the UI `evts` state, so `setEvts([])` on chat switch no longer wipes the metadata buffer that `saved_events` reads from at stream finalization. Pills persist on the completed message.

### Cleanup
- **Sentinel cleanup** — The `$$` backtick-masking in `md()` previously used null-byte sentinels, which made grep treat the frontend file as binary. Swapped for Unicode PUA characters (U+E000 / U+E001). Footnote sentinels use U+E010.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed operator-precedence bug in `tools.py` execute_code error hinting — `"no such file" in err or "not found" in err and "command" not in err` was bound as `or (... and ...)`, silently skipping the `command` guard on the "no such file" branch. Parens now force the intended grouping.
- Fixed dead-code `or` fallback in `run_shell` result text — `f"exit code: {exit_code}\n{out}{err}" or "(no output)"` is always truthy because the f-string contains literal text, so the no-output fallback never fired. Replaced with an explicit `if (stdout or stderr)` branch.
- Fixed `analyze_workspace` crashing on malformed LLM JSON — the topic parser sliced `raw[start:end+1]` without checking `end > start`. If the response had `[` but no `]`, the empty slice raised inside `json.loads`. Added the `end > start` guard so it falls back to `[]` cleanly.
- Fixed invalid CORS configuration — `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_credentials=True` is rejected by browsers per the CORS spec. Switched `allow_credentials` to `False` so preflight requests succeed.
- Fixed XSS in full-text conversation search — SQLite's `snippet()` wraps matches in `<mark>` tags but does NOT HTML-escape surrounding message content, and the frontend rendered it via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. A malicious message could inject script/iframe tags that executed when searched. Snippet is now fully HTML-escaped with only `<mark>`/`</mark>` re-enabled.
- Fixed `pull_model` silently returning empty on upstream errors — the streaming generator never checked `response.status_code` before iterating, so non-200 responses from Ollama produced no SSE events. Now yields a clear error event and bails out.
- Fixed unbounded growth of `_indexing_status` dict — every KB file upload left a permanent entry. Terminal `done`/`error` statuses are now evicted on read.
- Fixed deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` calls in `agents/chat.py` — replaced with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` to silence deprecation warnings in Python 3.10+ and avoid the "no running loop" edge case on future versions.
- Reduced chat-loop allocations — the per-round `_PARALLEL_SAFE` set and 22-entry `_TOOL_ICONS` dict are now module-level constants instead of being rebuilt every tool-calling round.
- Minor: avatar upload no longer evaluates `file.filename or ""` three times in one expression.


## Alpha v16.1 — April 2026

### New Features
- **PDF Chat Attachments** — Drag-and-drop or paste PDF files into chat; text is extracted server-side via `pypdf` and injected as readable content with page markers. Dedicated PDF chip with page count and loading state.
- **`POST /api/extract-pdf`** — Standalone PDF text extraction endpoint (up to 50MB)

### Coder Bot Overhaul
- **Plan-first architecture** — The bot plans before calling tools. Configurable planning model in Settings (thinking models recommended).
- **Smart OpenHands routing** — Automatically decides whether to use the OpenHands agent based on project complexity (3+ files triggers agent).
- **Overseer verification** — After the agent finishes, the overseer reviews output against user specs and re-prompts if needed.
- **Project-level `generate_code`** — One call builds the entire project (source, configs, manifests) instead of one file at a time.
- **Isolated workspaces** — Each OpenHands run gets `/root/project-{uuid}`, preventing file contamination across tasks.
- **Filesystem snapshot diffing** — Replaces unreliable event parsing; `find -mmin -10` fallback catches every created file.
- **Auto-package on success** — Download link returned in the same tool result, no extra round-trip.
- **Per-language task hints** — Python venv, Vite for React, cargo, go mod, javac, etc. plus "install EVERY dependency" rule.
- **Stuck detector** — Stuck-with-files = success; stuck-without-files = clean error with last 5 agent steps.
- **Live progress pills** — Real-time status icons (wand, package, microscope, eye, archive) from the worker.
- **Higher limits** — `OPENHANDS_MAX_ROUNDS` 6 → 12, HTTP timeout 300s → 600s for larger projects.
- **PROJECT COMPLETE guard** — After success, blocks further tool calls except `download_project`.
- **Rescue loop guard** — After a `generate_code` error, rescue path disabled to prevent infinite code-dump loops.
- **Context pruning** — `MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS=50000` truncates old tool results to prevent context explosion.
- **Near-duplicate detection** — Tracks last 3 tool-call signatures to catch retries across non-adjacent rounds.
- **Dev server detection** — Warns agent instead of hanging on `npm run dev`, `flask run`, `uvicorn`, etc.
- **Repeated-error stop** — Same error 3x in a row breaks the loop and forces a summary.
- **Clean archive names** — `project-abc12345.tar.gz` normalized to `project.tar.gz`.

### UI Improvements
- **ArchiveLink component** — Expandable file tree for `.tar.gz`/`.zip` downloads with preview toggle.
- **Markdown links** — `[text](url)` rendering in chat; archive links auto-upgrade to ArchiveLink.
- **List rendering** — Bullet and numbered lists render as proper HTML lists.
- **PDF badge in chat** — Uploaded PDFs display as a compact `📄 filename.pdf  N pages` badge instead of dumping extracted text into the message bubble. Full text is still sent to the model.
- **New chat remembers model** — New chats default to the last model you used (persisted in localStorage) instead of the first model in the list.
- Drag overlay now mentions PDF support.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed conversations merging on fresh start due to incorrect database loading order
- Fixed RAG purge only deleting from database, not disk

- Fixed Coder Bot hanging on dev server commands (`npm run dev`, `npm start`, etc.)
- Fixed workspace analysis not surfacing errors — Ollama failures now return proper HTTP status and error detail
- Fixed workspace analysis timeout (30s → 60s) for slower models
- Fixed OpenHands not receiving uploaded project files — `generate_code` now auto-resolves the active project for the conversation so the agent works inside the user's uploaded project directory
- Fixed quick search results bleeding between conversations — results now clear on conversation switch
- Fixed new chat defaulting to first model in list instead of the last model the user actually used
- Fixed last-used model not persisting — `hc-last-model` now saved on every message send and seeded from most recent conversation on first load
- Fixed stale model references on conversations — `sendMessages` auto-detects deleted models and falls back to first available
- Fixed cryptic Ollama errors — "model not found" and corrupt model errors ("Error in input stream") now show clear, actionable messages instead of raw Ollama output
- Fixed auto-title using wrong model — now uses the user's workspace analysis model from Settings instead of the backend default
- Fixed auto-title not firing reliably — stale React closure caused message count check to miss; now triggers based on conversation title instead
- Fixed workspace file preview panel not showing when Workspace tab is active — preview panel moved outside panel ternary so it renders alongside any active panel

- Fixes to Coderbot and how it operates with OpenHands.
- Fixes to step output from the coding agent (no more `[]%!` escape characters), steps should be much clearer to understand.
- Fixed status pills from still apearing in saved chats, updated to show completed rather staying in a generating state.
